    "1. Call the cost of your dream home total_cost.\n",

    "2. Call the portion of the cost needed for a down payment portion_down_payment. For simplicity, assume that portion_down_payment = 0.25 (25%).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Call the amount that you have saved thus far current_savings. You start with a current savings of $0. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Assume that you invest your current savings wisely, with an annual return of r (in other words,\n",
    "at the end of each month, you receive an additional current_savings*r/12 funds to put into\n",
    "your savings â€“ the 12 is because r is an annual rate). Assume that your investments earn a \n",
    "return of r = 0.04 (4%).\n",

    "5. Assume your annual salary is annual_salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Assume you are going to dedicate a certain amount of your salary each month to saving for \n",
    "the down payment. Call that portion_saved. This variable should be in decimal form (i.e. 0.1\n",
    "for 10%). \n",
    "\n",
    "7. At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the return on your investment,\n",
    "plus a percentage of your monthly salary (annual salary / 12).\n",
